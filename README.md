# ImgLib2-Notebooks
Scala Notebooks showing off ImgLib2.

## Setup
The notebooks are in the format of IPython Notebooks and were created using the [Jupyter Scala Implementation](https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala). They should work with other (IScala, Scala Notebook), but probably require adaptions for loading repositories.

## ImgLib2 Demo

The notebook goes through the using ops [demo](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials/tree/master/using-ops) in a Notebook

## Creating an Op 

A demo for [creating ops](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials/tree/master/create-a-new-op)

## Zoom Interpolate

A demo for ImgLib2 and its _views_ and specifically the ability to interpolate with a number of different algorithms.

## Bokeh Demos

The Bokeh Demos show creating simple plots (like histograms) in the notebook using bokehjs (bokeh-scala).
